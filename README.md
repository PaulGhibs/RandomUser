And show you a worldwide users, or each country code users.

## How it works?
Let's make an application! technical test

Build an application that fetches data from this API - https://randomuser.me - and displays a list of Users. Start by
reading the API documentation https://randomuser.me/documentation. Your application should fetch multiple pages
of Users from that API and display a list of Users with first and last names on one line and the email below. Following
pages should be fetched when users scroll the list. 
While offline, previously loaded Users should still be accessible
from the list and the details page. From the list, users should be able to click on a user to navigate to its details. The
application should display users first, last names and their picture on the details page.


## › Code guidelines
Use any third-party libraries you'd need. -> 
  pod 'NVActivityIndicatorView'
  pod "EmptyDataSet-Swift", '~> 5.0.0'
  pod 'SDWebImage', '~> 5.0'
  

## We favour quality over quantity, so here are a few things you
should keep in mind:

• apply clean architecture standards
• apply developers good practices (SOLID, KISS, DRY etc.)
• cover some classes with tests (no need to cover everything)
• target: min iOS13
